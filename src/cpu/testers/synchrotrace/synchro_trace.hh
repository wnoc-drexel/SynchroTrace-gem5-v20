/* SynchroTrace's trace replay is a 1-CPI timing model that interfaces with
 * the multi-threaded traces from Sigil to inject traffic into the detailed
 * memory model.
 *
 * The capture tool, Sigil, leverages the Valgrind dynamic binary
 * instrumentation tool. The processed instructions from the native
 * multi-threaded applications are abstracted into (3) events:
 * Computation (Work performed local to a thread), Communication (Read/Write
 * dependencies between threads), and Synchronization (embedded pthread calls
 * for each thread). These events form a trace for each individual thread,
 * so that these threads may progress in parallel when replaying the traces.
 *
 * SynchroTrace's trace replay is comprised of one tester module of type
 * MemObject and contains the contexts of each individual cores. Each core's
 * events are scheduled into the global event queue as
 * 'coreEvents[processor]'. The replay module connects each core context to
 * each of the ports of the private L1s of the memory model. In addition to
 * the core contexts, a back-end simulation thread runs periodically to
 * replenish the events data structure for each thread and check if the
 * simulation has been completed.
 *
 * Each line of the traces are parsed (by STParser) into events, which are
 * contained in 'eventMap'. 'eventMap' is a list of pointers to each thread's
 * deque of events. As the events of the traces are potentially comprised of
 * multiple memory requests, events are broken up into sub events for each
 * request. These sub events hold a divided portion of the compute ops, as
 * well as one request.
 *
 * The normal execution flow of the replay module is as follows:
 *  1) Processor wakes up
 *  2) Sub events are generated for the top event of the thread
 *  3) Based on the compute ops for that subevent, a trigger time is
 *  scheduled to wakeup the core sometime in the future. The timing for the
 *  compute ops are configurable via the command line options 'cpi_iops' and
 *  'cpi_flops'.
 *  4) When the subevent's trigger time has been reached, a read or write
 *  request is sent out to the memory system and the core essentially blocks.
 *  5) Eventually the memory request returns as a "hitCallback" and the next
 *  subevent or event is scheduled.
 *
 * In the case of synchronization events:
 *  1) Once the master thread obtains a "create", it issues a wakeup to the
 *  slave thread. The master thread will also wait on a "join".
 *  2) Threads can attempt to obtain or release mutex locks and are held in
 *  barrier fences to preserve the native synchronization behavior.
 *
 * In the case of communication events, the replay module will enforce
 * producer->consumer dependencies by forcing the consumer thread to wait on
 * the producer thread reaching the dependent event. After the producer
 * thread has reached the dependent event, the consumer thread will then send
 * its memory read request to the memory system.
 *
 * The SynchroTrace replay module handles the scheduling of multiple
 * threads per core. After each event is completed, the replay module checks
 * if there is an available thread on that core to schedule and swaps
 * accordingly.
